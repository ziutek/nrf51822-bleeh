The kit operates stand alone, and is based around a small module with headers for all IO pins, 2 buttons, 2 LED's as well as a built in Segger on board programming and debugging over USB solution. This board is accompanied by an USB dongle with identical except for access to I/O pins. This board can act as wireless peer device or it can act as a very small Software development platform in itself. The kit also contains 5 IC samples. The evaluation kit is supported by pre-qualified Bluetooth low energy stacks offered as Softdevices as well as (limited) library and code example support in the nRF51 Software Development kit supporting all nRF51 series devices.

Please note that progamming and debugging functionality on the evaluation kit is limited to the devices in the kit itself. To be able to program and debug on your own hardware, you will need a standalone programmer/debugger (Jlink lite or Jlink Pro) which are included in the nRF51822 Development Kit as well as available for purchase on www.segger.com
